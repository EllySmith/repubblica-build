# New Build Template for LaRepubblica

The build template of La Repubblica is not good, so I made a new one!

The app is scraping data from 'repubblica.it' homepage and constructs a new page with better design. Only free contet is available. Navigation menu links lead to the original website.

# Technology Used

### React
- App construction

### Redux
- State management

### Express.js
- Server for data fetching

### Cheerio and CORS
- HTML parsing and handling cross-origin requests

### Tailwind
- Styling and cross browser adaptation


## Deployment

Only static components work, for data fetching run the server:
