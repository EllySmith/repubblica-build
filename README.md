## New Build Template for LaRepubblica

The build template of La Repubblica is awfulnot good, so I made a new one!

The app is scraping data from 'repubblica.it' homepage and constructs a new page with better design. Only free contet is available. Navigation menu links lead to the original website.

## Technology Used

# React
- App construction

# Redux
- State management

# Express.js
- Server for data fetching

# Cheerio and CORS
- HTML parsing and handling cross-origin requests

# Tailwind
- Styling and cross browser adaptation


Deployment (only) static components work, for data fetching run the server:
[https://repubblica-build.vercel.app/](https://repubblica-build.vercel.app/)
